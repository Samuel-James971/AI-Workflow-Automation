# AI-Workflow-Automation

 <h2>Description</h2>
In this AI driven project, I have explored the use of Tines, a workflow automation platform, to better understand how routine proccesses within cybersecurity can be streamlined through automation. The project involved using Elastic SIEM to generate security alerts, which were then automatically ingested by Tines. Tines then processed and evaluated the alerts, ultimately triggering an email notification.
